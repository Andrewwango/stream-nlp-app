I wanted to buy the Will & Grace DVD Series. Well, I decided to buy this Box Set. This item was not even shipped from the Store, if you will, when I was sent an E-mail that this was about the set. It was not a region 1 set. the region 0 was a bit iffy and one of the disc sets, I think it was season 6 that was said that had Asian characters on the DVD or Incorporated into the DVDs some how. I did not want these. As they very well could be pirated DVDs and I am not buying Pirated anything. For fear of the Law.
